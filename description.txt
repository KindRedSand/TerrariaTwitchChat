[c/ff3937:Please, report ANY issues with mod in discord.]
[c/ff3937:Things never get fixed if i don't know about it!]

I also working on vanilla version of TwitchChat (Only chat). You can find download link in discord or use [c/98f6ef:xb7MxHu].

Now with cached emoticons
Note, mod no more only client side and marked as NoSync what mean mod still not disabling when joining server and also can be loaded at server without requiring clients haave what mod
Server side Fun features can be synced if mod enabled in both client and server 
Nothing happens on server if [c/98f6ef:EnableFun] = false

After you install this mod enter any world and type 
Windows only:
  [c/98f6ef:/t settings] to open settings file or [c/98f6ef:/t open] to open config folder. 
  Wait some time until OS ask you how to open .cfg file and use any text editor to edit fields

Linux/MacOS:
Or go to /ModLoader/Mods folder (In [c/d6791a:Mods] menu click [c/d6791a:Open Mods Folder]) Cache/Twitch/Twitch.ini and open it manually
[c/98f6ef:/t open] can work too, but not guarated.

[c/98f6ef:Channel] -> stream channel name starting with [c/98f6ef:#] and should be in LOWER CASE!
Feel free just copy it from url:
www.twitch.tv/[c/98f6ef:kindredthefox]

[c/98f6ef:Username] -> Your username in twitch in lower case

[c/98f6ef:OAToken] -> Your "password" what allow you enter the chat. Never paste here your own password
Use only token what you get from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ 
It should starts with [c/98f6ef:oauth:] and 30 symbols.

[c/98f6ef:IgnoreCommands] Does mod should ignore commands (messages starting from [c/98f6ef:!] for example)
Also enables ignoring bot messages and your own messages (in case selfbotting).
Enable it after you enshure what you see meessages from twitch.

[c/98f6ef:EnableFun] Experimental implementation of [c/98f6ef:Twitch Plays Terraria]. 
Still lack of content, but if you want create a content pack, dm me in discord [c/d6791a:KindRed-Sand#2340]

After this save all changes and type
[c/98f6ef:/t reload] to apply changes and force mod to reconnect

/ModLoader/Mods/Cache/Twitch/emoticons

Also, each emote loaded from twitch chat can be reused using \[e:EmoteAlias] tag
