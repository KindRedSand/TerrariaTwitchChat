This mod print text from stream in game chat

[c/ff3937:Please, report ANY issues with mod in discord.]
[c/ff3937:Things never get fixed if i don't know about it!]

Now config can be changed using in game config menu, but config file still used to load mod!


[c/98f6ef:OAToken] -> Your "password" what allow you enter the chat. Never paste here your own password
Use only token what you get from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ 
It should starts with [c/98f6ef:oauth:] and 30 symbols.

[c/98f6ef:IgnoreCommands] Does mod should ignore commands (messages starting from [c/98f6ef:!] for example)
Also enables ignoring bot messages and your own messages (in case selfbotting).
Enable it after you enshure what you see meessages from twitch.

[c/98f6ef:EnableFun] Experimental implementation of [c/98f6ef:Twitch Plays Terraria]. 
Still lack of content, but if you want create a content pack use template from github or decompile example module mod or dm me in discord [c/d6791a:KindRed-Sand#2340]

After changin anything in config save all changes and type
[c/98f6ef:/t reload] to apply changes and force mod to reconnect

All emoticons what your game was loaded stores on your disc at 
/ModLoader/Mods/Cache/Twitch/emoticons

Also each emote loaded from twitch chat can be reused using \[e:EmoteAlias] tag

You can also send messages in chat using
[c/98f6ef:/t m Your Text Here]
